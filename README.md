# k-es

Kotlin library for persistance through event-sourced aggregates. Support for projections and sagas included, check out the demo-app to see how it all fits together.

Currently supports ESJC (netty based client for [eventstore.org](https://eventstore.org/)) as a aggregate repository and sql server as a command and saga repository.
